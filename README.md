# Pixi learning examples
This repository consist on examples made while reading https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi.
The propose of this repo is to share how I learned PIXI and how I include it with React.

The final stage, the game, isn't exactly as explained by @kittykattack: I module it. This could be a good start point to understand how can be decoupled a pixi game with ES6.
